# Discord Bot with Interactive Components

This project sets up a Discord bot utilizing the Discord.js library, providing interactive components such as buttons, sections, and attachments. The bot is equipped to register and handle slash commands and demonstrates how to structure replies with dynamic UI elements.

## Features

- **Command Registration:** Automatically registers slash commands (`/test`) with the Discord API.
- **Interactive UI Components:** Creates sections with buttons and text displays.
- **File Attachments:** Responds with a file (`NiNJA.xex`) and integrates it into the message.
- **Environment Variables:** Uses `.env` for secure storage of `TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Discord.js v14 or later:** The bot relies on the latest version for advanced features.
- **Dotenv:** To manage environment variables securely.
